# Low-Level Drivers Exploration

This repository is dedicated to my journey in learning low-level driver development on the STM32 G070 Nucleo, using STM32CubeIDE. I am currently writing drivers for both SPI and I2C devices, including the MPU6050 accelerometer.

## Overview

- **Platform:** STM32 G070 Nucleo
- **Development Environment:** STM32CubeIDE
- **Focus:** Developing low-level drivers for SPI and I2C communication protocols
- **Included Drivers:**
  - MPU6050 (I2C)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danielga36/Low-Level-Drivers-Exploration.git
   cd Low-Level-Drivers-Exploration
   ```

2. **Setting up `printf` on STM32 G070 Nucleo:**
   To get `printf` working on the STM32 Nucleo G070, you can follow this [link](https://shawnhymel.com/1873/how-to-use-printf-on-stm32/).
